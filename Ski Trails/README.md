## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

<b> This Problem has been taken from 30 days SQL Challenge by Thoufiq Mohammed (Day 2)</b>

  <b>Table Name : mountain_huts</b>

|  Column Name  |Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| id     | integer  |
| name  | varchar(40)  |
| altitude   | integer     |

  <b>Table Name : trails</b>

|  Column Name  |Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| hut1     | integer  |
| hut2   | integer     |


A ski resort company is planning to construct a new ski slope using a pre-existing network of mountain huts and trails between them. A new slope has to begin at one of the mountain huts, have a middle station at another hut connected with the first one by a direct trail, and end at the third mountain hut which is also connected by a direct trail to the second hut. The altitude of the three huts chosen for constructing the ski slope has to be strictly decreasing.

Each entry in the table trails represents a direct connection between huts with IDs hut1 and hut2. Note that all trails are bidirectional.

Create a query that finds all triplets(startpt,middlept,endpt) representing the mountain huts that may be used for construction of a ski slope.


Assume that:
* there is no trail going from a hut back to itself;
* for every two huts there is at most one direct trail connecting them;
* each hut from table trails occurs in table mountain_huts;

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.
