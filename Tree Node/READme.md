## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

  <b>Table Name : Queue</b>

|  Column Name  |Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| id   | int     |
| p_id | varchar |

* <b>id is the column with unique values for this table. </b>
* Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree (represented by p_id).
* The given structure is always a valid tree.
<br/>

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

* "Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
* "Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
* "Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

Write a solution to report the type of each node in the tree.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
