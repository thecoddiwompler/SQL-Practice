## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement


  <b>Table Name : cricket_runs</b>

|  Column Name  |Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ball_no  | integer  |
| runs  | integer  |
| delivery_type  | varchar(20)  |

* <b>ball_no is the primary key for this table. </br>
</b>

In an ODI cricket match, you have a dataset representing deliveries during the match. The dataset contains three columns: ball_no (delivery number in the match), runs (runs scored on that delivery), and delivery_type (type of delivery: legal, nb for no ball, or wd for wide).

Write a SQL query to find the runs scored in every over.  

There are a few special conditions to consider:

* There can be two or more consecutive extra deliveries (e.g., two consecutive wide balls).
* Runs can be scored on extra deliveries as well. For example, a boundary on a no-ball or a wide ball. In this case, a total of 5 runs would be counted.


Return the result table in the increasing order of overs.  

The query result format is in the following example:
