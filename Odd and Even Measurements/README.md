## This problem was asked in Google Interview.

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

  <b>Table Name : Measurements</b>

|  Column Name  |Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| measurement_id  | INTEGER  |
| measurement_value  | DECIMAL  |
| measurement_time | TIMESTAMP |

<b>measurement_id is the primary key of this table.</b>
</br>

Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.

</br>
  
Write a SQL query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.

</br>

Definition:
<br>
Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.

Return the result table in the order of measurement day.

The query result format is in the following example.
