| stock_name    | varchar |
| operation     | enum    |
| operation_day | int     |
| price         | int     |


<b> (stock_name, operation_day) is the primary key for this table. </b><br/>
<br/>
The operation column is an ENUM of type ('Sell', 'Buy'). </br>
Each row of this table indicates that the stock which has stock_name had an operation on the day operation_day with the price.</br>
It is guaranteed that each 'Sell' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Buy' operation in a previous day. It is also guaranteed that each 'Buy' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Sell' operation in an upcoming day.
