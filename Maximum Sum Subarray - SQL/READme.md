## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

<b>I found this problem on Codechef.</b>

Given an array A = [A[1], A[2], ..., A[N]] you need to find the maximum sum among all its subarrays.

Note that a subarray is any contiguous set of elements of the array.

However, the array is given to you as a database table:

You have a table `ArrayTable`, with 2 columns, as follows:

  <b>Table Name : ArrayTable</b>
</br>
|  Column Name  |Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| key1  | int  |
| val1  | int  |

* key1 corresponds to the index, and val1 corresponds to the value. That is, A[key1]=val1
* It is guaranteed that if there are a total of N rows in the table, then all the key1s are exactly {1,2,‚Ä¶,N}.
<br/>

<br/>

Write a SQL query to find the maximum sum among all its subarrays.
