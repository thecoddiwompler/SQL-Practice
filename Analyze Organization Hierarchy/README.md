## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

| Column Name    | Type    | 
|----------------|---------|
| employee_id    | int     |
| employee_name  | varchar |
| manager_id     | int     |
| salary         | int     |
| department     | varchar |

employee_id is the unique key for this table.<br>
<br>
Each row contains information about an employee, including their ID, name, their manager's ID, salary, and department.<br>
<br>
manager_id is null for the top-level manager (CEO).<br>

<b>Write a SQL query to analyze the organizational hierarchy and answer the following:</b>

<b>Hierarchy Levels:</b> For each employee, determine their level in the organization (CEO is level 1, employees reporting directly to the CEO are level 2, and so on).<br>

<b>Team Size:</b> For each employee who is a manager, count the total number of employees under them (direct and indirect reports).<br>

<b>Salary Budget:</b> For each manager, calculate the total salary budget they control (sum of salaries of all employees under them, including indirect reports, plus their own salary).<br>

Return the result table ordered by the result ordered by level in ascending order, then by budget in descending order, and finally by employee_name in ascending order.

<b>The result format is in the following example</b>
