## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

  <b>Table Name : Employee</b>

|  Column Name  |Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| id          | int  |
| month       | int  |
| salary      | int  |

* (id, month) is the primary key for this table.
* Each row in the table indicates the salary of an employee in one month during the year 2020.
<br/>



Write an SQL query to calculate the cumulative salary summary for every employee in a single unified table.
</br>

The cumulative salary summary for an employee can be calculated as follows:
- For each month that the employee worked, sum up the salaries in that month and the previous two months.
- This is their 3-month sum for that month. If an employee did not work for the company in previous months,
their effective salary for those months is 0.
- Do not include the 3-month sum for the most recent month that the employee worked for in the summary.
- Do not include the 3-month sum for any month the employee did not work.


Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order. In case of a tie, order it by month in descending order.
The query result format is in the following example.
