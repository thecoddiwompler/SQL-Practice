## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

  <b>Table Name : Customer</b>

|  Column Name  |Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |

<b>(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.</b> </br>
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.  
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.  
amount is the total paid by a customer. </br>
</br>
You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).  
</br>
Write a SQL query to compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.  

Return result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.</br>
</br>
The query result format is in the following example:
