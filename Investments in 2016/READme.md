## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

  <b>Table Name : Insurance</b>

|  Column Name  |Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| pid         | int   |
| tiv_2015    | float |
| tiv_2016    | float |
| lat         | float |
| lon         | float |

<b>pid is the primary key column for this table.</b>
</br>

<b> Each row of this table contains information about one policy where:</b>  
* pid is the policyholder's policy ID.  
* tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016.  
* lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.  
* lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.  
</br>
  
<b> Write a SQL query to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:</b>  

* have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and  
* are not located in the same city like any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).
</br>
Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.  
</br>
</br>
Return the result table in any order.  
</br>
</br>
The query result format is in the following example.
